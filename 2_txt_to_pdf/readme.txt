Add .txt files under "text_files" folder.
Then start script 'text_to_pdf.py' under utf8 folder.
This will first encode the txt's to utf8 files, and then create pdf's under pdf folder.
Reason for this was to create pdf's out of txt files that were saved in ANSI, but contained
    cyrillic characters and due to that were displayed ad unknown symbols.
